Renewlet is a self-hosted ledger for people who subscribe to too many tools. It puts prices, renewal dates, budgets, currencies, logos, and reminders for SaaS, AI tools, cloud services, and developer tools in one place, so the next charge is never a surprise.

Idle memory usage is around 20-30MiB in local testing, making it comfortable for small VPS, NAS, and homelab boxes.

## Quick Deploy

On a machine with Docker and Docker Compose v2:

```bash
mkdir -p renewlet && cd renewlet
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zhiyingzzhou/renewlet/main/deploy/docker-deploy.sh | bash
docker compose up -d
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:3000/setup
```

Create the first admin user. The deploy script creates `docker-compose.yml`, `.env`, and `data/`, then generates `PB_ENCRYPTION_KEY` and `CRON_SECRET` for you.

If Docker Hub is unavailable, switch the image in `.env` to GHCR:

```env
RENEWLET_IMAGE="ghcr.io/zhiyingzzhou/renewlet:latest"
```

Then pull and restart:

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

Common settings live in `.env`:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `PORT` | Public port, `3000` by default. |
| `APP_URL` | Public app URL used for links in emails and notifications. |
| `RENEWLET_IMAGE` | Docker image, `zhiyingzzhou/renewlet:latest` by default. |
| `TZ` | Container time zone, mainly for logs; reminders use each user's time zone. |
| `PB_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | Encryption key for sensitive PocketBase settings. Do not rotate it casually after deployment. |
| `CRON_SECRET` | Bearer secret for external Cron calls to `/api/cron/notifications`. |
| `NOTIFICATION_SCHEDULER_ENABLED` | Enables the built-in notification scheduler. Defaults to `true`. |
| `SMTP_HOST` / `SMTP_FROM` | Enables PocketBase password-reset email when configured. |

## Highlights

- Track each subscription clearly: name, logo, price, currency, billing cycle, renewal date, status, category, payment method, tags, website, and notes.
- Understand spending: normalize costs by month and year, then review budget usage, category breakdowns, payment-method charts, and inactive-subscription savings.
- Get renewal reminders: jobs are generated from each user's IANA time zone and local notification time, with reminder days, repeat reminders, delivery history, and failed-send retries.
- Send notifications through six channels: Telegram, Notifyx, Webhook, WeCom Bot, SMTP email, and Bark.
- Handle multiple currencies: choose Exchange API or FloatRates JSON Feeds, with fallback rates when remote providers are unavailable.
- Customize your lists: categories, payment methods, and currencies can be adjusted in settings, with built-in icons for common payment methods.
- Self-host one container: React frontend, Go/PocketBase backend, SQLite data, and static assets run together, with data persisted to `data/`.
- Switch languages in the app: Simplified Chinese and English are supported.

## Operations

Check status and logs:

```bash
docker compose ps
docker compose logs -f
```

Back up data and config before upgrading:

```bash
tar -czf renewlet-backup-$(date +%F).tgz .env docker-compose.yml data
```

Upgrade to the latest image:

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
docker compose logs -f
```

Stop the service while keeping data:

```bash
docker compose down
```

## Local Development

Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Start the backend:

```bash
pnpm --dir packages/server start
```

Start the frontend:

```bash
pnpm --filter @renewlet/client dev
```

Local Vite runs at `http://localhost:5173` and proxies `/api` and `/_` to `http://127.0.0.1:3000`.

Build:

```bash
pnpm build
```

Common checks:

```bash
pnpm check:file-lines
pnpm check:deploy
pnpm --filter @renewlet/client typecheck
pnpm --dir packages/server test
pnpm test:all
```
